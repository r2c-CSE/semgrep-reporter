javascript.express.security.injection.tainted-sql-string.tainted-sql-string,"Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice because manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using an object-relational mapper (ORM) such as Sequelize which will protect your queries.",open,2024-07-26T02:04:37.719613Z,high,medium,untriaged,,,,"{'name': 'securingsoftware/forum-service', 'url': 'https://gitlab.com/securingsoftware/forum-service'}","{'file_path': 'sqli-sequelize.ts', 'line': 5, 'column': 76, 'end_line': 5, 'end_column': 84}"
